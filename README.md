# ADT-Robot
Homework assignment where I implemented a data type that represents a simplified robot

In this assigment I provided two implentations for a simplified ADT for a robot. 
The two implementations use different data structures, but implement the same ADT.

The robot is just a collection of parts, which are represented by strings. This ADT is defined by the interface Robot.

The ArrayRobot Class:
This class implements the ADT using an array to hold parts. It cannot hold more than 10 parts in any combination (arms,legs,heads).

The VariablesRobot Class:
This class implements the ADT using six variables: two for the arms, two for the legs an two for other parts. It cannot hold more than two parts in each of these categories.

This assignment was for us to understand the difference between data structures and ADTs and to demonstrate that we can implement the same ADT to different data structures.
